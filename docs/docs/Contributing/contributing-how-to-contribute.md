ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! 

We welcome contributions from developers of all levels to our open-source project onÂ [GitHub](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow). If you'd like to contribute, please check our contributing guidelines and help make Langflow more accessible.



As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether in the form of a new feature, improved infra, or better documentation.



To contribute to this project, please follow aÂ ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)Â workflow. Please do not try to push directly to this repo unless you are a maintainer.


## Local Development {#0388cc3c758d434d994022863a6bafa9}


---


You can develop Langflow using docker compose, or locally.


We provide aÂ `.vscode/launch.json`Â file for debugging the backend in VSCode, which is a lot faster than using docker compose.


Setting up hooks:


`make init`


This will install the pre-commit hooks, which will runÂ `make format`Â on every commit.


It is advised to runÂ `make lint`Â before pushing to the repository.


## Run Locally {#5225c2ef0cd6403c9f6c6bbd888115e0}


---


Langflow can run locally by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies. We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies from your system.


Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Poetry (&gt;=1.4)
- Node.js

Then, in the root folder, install the dependencies and start the development server for the backend:


`make backend`


And the frontend:


`make frontend`


## Docker Compose {#b07f359414ff4220ac615afc364ee46e}


---


The following snippet will run the backend and frontend in separate containers. The frontend will be available atÂ `localhost:3000`Â and the backend atÂ `localhost:7860`.


`docker compose up --build# ormake dev build=1`


## Documentation {#5f34bcaeccdc4489b0c5ee2c4a21354e}


---


The documentation is built usingÂ [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). To run the documentation locally, run the following commands:


`cd docsnpm installnpm run start`


The documentation will be available atÂ `localhost:3000`Â and all the files are located in theÂ `docs/docs`Â folder. Once you are done with your changes, you can create a Pull Request to theÂ `main`Â branch.


## Submitting Components {#9676353bc4504551a4014dd572ac8be8}


---


New components are added as objects of theÂ [CustomComponent](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/dev/src/backend/base/langflow/interface/custom/custom_component/custom_component.py)Â class and any dependencies are added to theÂ [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/dev/pyproject.toml#L27)Â file.


### Add an example component {#8caae106c853465d83183e7f5272e4d8}


You have a new document loader calledÂ **MyCustomDocumentLoader**Â and it would look awesome in Langflow.

1. Write your loader as an object of theÂ [CustomComponent](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/dev/src/backend/base/langflow/interface/custom/custom_component/custom_component.py)Â class. You'll create a new class,Â `MyCustomDocumentLoader`, that will inherit fromÂ `CustomComponent`Â and override the base class's methods.
2. Define optional attributes likeÂ `display_name`,Â `description`, andÂ `documentation`Â to provide information about your custom component.
3. Implement theÂ `build_config`Â method to define the configuration options for your custom component.
4. Implement theÂ `build`Â method to define the logic for taking input parameters specified in theÂ `build_config`Â method and returning the desired output.
5. Add the code to theÂ [/components/documentloaders](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/tree/dev/src/backend/base/langflow/components)Â folder.
6. Add the dependency toÂ [/documentloaders/__init__.py](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/dev/src/backend/base/langflow/components/documentloaders/__init__.py)Â asÂ `from .MyCustomDocumentLoader import MyCustomDocumentLoader`.
7. Add any new dependencies to the outerÂ [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/dev/pyproject.toml#L27)Â file.
8. Submit documentation for your component. For this example, you'd submit documentation to theÂ [loaders page](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/blob/dev/docs/docs/components/loaders).
9. Submit your changes as a pull request. The Langflow team will have a look, suggest changes, and add your component to Langflow.

## User Sharing {#34ac32e11f344eab892b94531a21d2c9}


---


You might want to share and test your custom component with others, but don't need it merged into the main source code.


If so, you can share your component on the Langflow store.


1. [Register at the Langflow store](https://www.langflow.store/login/).


2. Undergo pre-validation before receiving an API key.


3. To deploy your amazing component directly to the Langflow store, without it being merged into the main source code, navigate to your flow, and then clickÂ **Share**. The share window appears:

4. Choose whether you want to flow to be public or private. You can alsoÂ **Export**Â your flow as a JSON file from this window. When you're ready to share the flow, clickÂ **Share Flow**. You should see aÂ **Flow shared successfully**Â popup.


5. To confirm, navigate to theÂ **Langflow Store**Â and filter results byÂ **Created By Me**. You should see your new flow on theÂ **Langflow Store**.
